# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer_Analysis for UC_Davis Bootcamp

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to sort, visualize, and analyze the performance and trends of a fictional rideshare company called PyBer. It tracks the total fares of 3 different city types over the first half of 2019. We will use the results we visualize to present and make recommendations to the CEO.

## Results

The dataframe created gives plenty of data to draw conclusions. We can determine those Urban cities generate the most rides and total fares by a considerable amount. Suburban is the next highest in those categories followed by Rural cities. Urban areas also have the most drivers followed by the Suburban cities then the Rural cities. The urban cities are also so heavily saturated by drivers, the average fare per ride and fare per driver are much lower than the other 2 categories.

## Plot Line analysis

By referencing the below line plot, we are able to determine the total fares never intersect. The urban cities are always the highest grossing, followed by suburban, then rural. Each city type does have an overall growth which shows the company is growing, and there is a high-volume spike towards the end of February for each city type.

## Recommendations

1. The first recommendation we have would be to gather more information on ride locations so we can create a heat map to determine which areas in each city generate the most business. I would recommend that we generate a heat map to make sure drivers are aware of these popular areas so they can arrive for rides in less time. A decrease in wait time will create a much more effective service.

2. The second recommendation would be to investigate the volume spikes on the line plot to determine what is causing the increases in volume. Once the company can determine what is causing the spike, they can more effectively allocate resources to make rides more readily available on these high-volume days.

3. Finally, I would recommend that the company increase the price of fares in urban areas. The company will not be able to maintain that volume of drivers in urban areas if they are only averaging $0.67 cents per fare. The company should also determine what is the most effective driver to ride ratio in order to maximize profits but still maintain a high level of service.
